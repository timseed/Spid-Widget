# Spid Widget

A test - to create a widget (Spid) and then to add that widget to a list on another Window.

# Signals

As the Widgets needs to communicate with other objects implement a "loose" couple piece of code.

The Widget EMITS a signal.... if there is nothing there to read it - So What....


The Main - connects (at run-time) to the known Widget Signals - and handles them in its own Method.
